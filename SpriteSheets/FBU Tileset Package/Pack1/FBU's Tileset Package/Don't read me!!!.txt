I knew you couldn't handle it.
Well, since you read the file, please take my words in
consideration:

You are free to use this graphics in your game as long as you give credits to these people:

- Enterbrain
- Mack
- Davias (Rips from the game Suikoden 2)
- Smithygcn (Rips from the game Tales of Destiny)

I don't believe in credits, so I would only ask you not to steal my work.
